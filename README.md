Code For America Dot Org
========================

## Description

Code for America is redoing our website.

For the past few months, we’ve worked with Colorado branding firm [Dojo4](http://dojo4.com/), Brighton web design firm [Clearleft](http://clearleft.com/), and our own internal communications and technology teams on a new visual design and front-end for the Code for America website. Today, we’re making the first of this work public and asking for input from the CfA community to ensure that the information presented on the site is accurate and up-to-date.

## Who’s Working On It

## How to contribute

#### Specific help we need
We need your help to keep our content accurate and up to date. The easiest way for to help is to submit a pull request with one of the below: 
* For members of the community including fellows, brigade captains, and staff, find yourself and your friends in the [big list of people](http://alpha.codeforamerica.org/people/) or one of the [lists of civic hackers](http://alpha.codeforamerica.org/geeks/our-geeks/) and let us know if your bio is correct and photo current. Personal photos should be about 200 x 200.
* If you built an app or project as part of the fellowship or accelerator programs, find it on the [apps page](http://alpha.codeforamerica.org/apps) and verify that we’ve got it described accurately.
* Check government information for brigades and fellowships on the [2014 government partners](http://alpha.codeforamerica.org/cities/2014-cities) and [alumni government partners]([http://alpha.codeforamerica.org/cities/alumni]) pages and fill in any blanks you might find.
* We need quality photos for page headers. Should be about 1200 x 500, JPG compressed to 150kb max.

#### <a name="pulls"></a>Submitting a Pull Request
An easy way to edit submit a pull request for just a change in text is to find the page you'd like to edit on the [static-site branch](https://github.com/codeforamerica/codeforamerica.org/tree/static-site). Then use Github's built in editor to make your changes. Down below the editor window, include a brief one sentence description of what you changed. Something like "Updated Andrew Hyder's bio". Click the green Propose File Change button. You'll get to review your changes. If everything looks right, click the green "Send pull request" button. Done!

If you need to add or replace an image, you'll need to:
1. Fork the project.
2. Create a topic branch.
3. Add the image in the correct directory.
4. Commit and push your changes.
5. Submit a pull request.
